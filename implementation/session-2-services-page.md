## Navigation Flow

### State Management

- Only one service category open at a time
- Smooth expand/collapse with CSS transitions

### Animations

- `hover-lift` utility for cards (translateY(-4px))
- Custom expand/collapse transitions (max-h, opacity)
- Icon hover color transitions (300ms)

### Responsive Behavior
- **Mobile (<640px):** Single column layouts, stacked cards
- **Tablet (640-1024px):** 2-column grids where appropriate
- **Desktop (>1024px):** Full multi-column layouts

## Commands

cd dax_labs
npm run dev
```

cd dax_labs
npm run build
```

### Access Services Page
- Local: http://localhost:3000/services
- Homepage: http://localhost:3000

---

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Accordion vs Separate Pages:** Chose accordion style for services to keep all information on one page (matches AKS IT Services pattern)

2. **Service Names:** Updated homepage service cards to exactly match AKS IT Services naming convention

3. **Navigation:** Header "Services" now links to dedicated page, not homepage anchor

4. **Sub-services Display:** Grid layout (2 columns) for readability and space efficiency

5. **Trust Indicators:** Added statistics in CTA section to build credibility (matches homepage stats)

## Color System Reference

All components use the existing color system from `globals.css`:
- `--color-bg-primary`: #ffffff (main background)
- `--color-bg-secondary`: #f8f9fa (section backgrounds)
- `--color-bg-tertiary`: #f1f3f4 (card backgrounds)
- `--color-text-primary`: #1a1a1a (main text)
- `--color-text-secondary`: #4a4a4a (secondary text)
- `--color-text-muted`: #717171 (muted text)
- `--color-accent`: #1a1a1a (buttons, links)
